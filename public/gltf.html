      Overview
    </h2>
    <p>
      For my 3D model, I used an add-on from Blender that has a mesh teapot. From there I watched
      this tutorial to play around with the idea of reflections. I then added this image of a butterfly that landed on a bouqet of flowers as the background that reflects onto the teapot. 
      Though when uploading the teapot gltf file into glitch, the textures/materials did not transfer. <br>

      To interact with the model, use your mouse to drag around the teapot and see the different angles!
